# Fibermade Personas

Personas represent the different types of people who use Fibermade.
They are defined by how they operate, not by years in business or scale.

---

# Creators

Creators are the makers — dyers, spinners, and fiber artists who produce and sell yarn.
Online sales are assumed for all creator personas and are not a differentiator.

## James (Creator - Dyer)
**Small Batch · Show-First**

### How James operates
James dyes in small, flexible batches. Colorways and quantities shift often based on intuition and recent sales. Most revenue comes from markets, trunk shows, and festivals. Online sales support shows but do not drive planning.

James values freedom and responsiveness over optimization. Selling out feels like success, even if the process is messy.

### What James is looking for in a tool
- Fast show prep without heavy upfront planning
- Lightweight inventory tracking that tolerates uncertainty
- Clear visibility into what sold at each show
- Simple workflows that don’t assume long-term commitments

### Features James wants
- Show-centric sales tracking
- Simple inventory adjustments
- Post-show reconciliation
- Minimal required setup

### Features James does NOT want
- Mandatory batch planning
- Wholesale-first assumptions
- Rigid inventory enforcement
- Tools that push subscriptions or recurring commitments

## Stephanie (Creator - Dyer)
**Small Batch · Wholesale-Selective**

### How Stephanie operates
Stephanie dyes small batches with an emphasis on consistency. She sells to a limited number of stores she trusts, often with flexible minimums and expectations. Wholesale matters, but she is careful not to overcommit.

Stephanie lives in the tension between creativity and reliability. She wants to be dependable without becoming industrial.

### What Stephanie is looking for in a tool
- Clear, low-stress wholesale workflows

## David (Creator - Dyer)
**Production Scale · Wholesale-First**

### How David operates
David runs a production-oriented dye operation. Dyeing is planned, repeatable, and scheduled well in advance. Wholesale orders and recurring commitments drive production decisions. Online sales exist but are secondary to stability.

David values predictability and accuracy. He is willing to sacrifice spontaneity for reliability.

### What David is looking for in a tool
- Clear translation from orders to production plans
- Strong inventory and order accuracy
- Support for recurring revenue like subscriptions

## Laura (Creator - Dyer)
**Production Scale · Show-Heavy**

### How Laura operates
Laura runs a large operation and relies heavily on festivals and events. Dyeing is scaled, but quantities and color emphasis shift based on show performance and regional demand. Wholesale exists, but shows are a major driver.

Laura is comfortable with complexity as long as the system bends instead of breaking.

### What Laura is looking for in a tool
- Efficient show prep at scale
- Tools to decide what to bring and how much
- Flexible inventory that moves between channels
- Fast, accurate post-show reconciliation

### Features Laura wants
- Show planning and prep tools
- Channel-aware inventory
- Sales reporting by show or event
- Flexible allocation of stock

### Features Laura does NOT want
- Treating shows as “just another order”
- Rigid inventory systems that can’t absorb chaos
- Wholesale-only mental models
- Overly simplified workflows that hide complexity

# Stores

Store owners are the buyers — they run yarn shops and purchase wholesale from creators.
They use Fibermade to discover, order, and manage their relationships with the creators they carry.

---

## Katherine (Store - Owner)
**Independent Yarn Shop · Multi-Creator**

### How Katherine operates
Katherine owns a small independent yarn shop. She carries yarn from several indie dyers and values the personal relationships she has with each one. She places wholesale orders a few times a year per creator, usually around seasonal shifts or when stock runs low.

Katherine juggles ordering from multiple creators, each with different terms, minimums, and lead times. She tracks most of this in spreadsheets or email threads and wishes it were simpler.

### What Katherine is looking for in a tool
- A single place to browse and order from the creators she works with
- Clear visibility into order status and expected delivery
- Easy access to each creator's terms and catalog
- A process that feels personal, not like a generic wholesale portal

### Features Katherine wants
- Browse a creator's catalog and place orders without back-and-forth emails
- See her order history and current order status at a glance
- Understand each creator's wholesale terms upfront (minimums, lead time, pricing)
- Receive clear communication when orders are accepted, fulfilled, or shipped

### Features Katherine does NOT want
- Having to create separate accounts for every creator
- Opaque ordering processes where she doesn't know what's happening
- Systems that feel designed for large retailers
- Pressure to commit to volumes that don't match her shop's pace

## Key Takeaway

Fibermade cannot optimize for all personas equally at all times.
Each persona represents a different set of tradeoffs:

**Creators:**
- James trades predictability for freedom
- Stephanie trades growth speed for sustainability
- David trades flexibility for stability
- Laura trades simplicity for adaptability

**Stores:**
- Katherine trades volume leverage for relationship depth

Product defaults, language, and onboarding will inevitably favor some of these tradeoffs over others.
That choice should be intentional.
