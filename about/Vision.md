# Fibermade Vision

## Purpose

Fibermade is a **commerce platform built for the fiber community**.

Not a generic ecommerce tool reskinned for makers.
Not a plugin bolted onto someone else's platform.

Fibermade is built from the ground up for how the fiber community actually works — creators, store owners, and the relationships between them.

We start with dyers because that's what we know firsthand. But the long-term vision is a platform that serves the specific needs of the entire fiber community we're part of.

## Core Belief

Most commerce tools are built for generic sellers. They treat every product, customer, and workflow the same.

The fiber community doesn't work that way.

- Makers create in small batches with unique constraints — dyers, pattern designers, tool makers, spinners, fiber sellers.
- Stores build relationships with individual makers, not faceless suppliers.
- Products are often handmade, limited, or made-to-order — not warehouse inventory.
- Wholesale happens through trust and personal relationships, not purchase order portals.
- The community is deeply interconnected — makers, shops, and customers all know each other.

Fibermade is built around these realities instead of forcing fiber people into workflows designed for someone else.

## Scope Discipline

Fibermade is intentionally opinionated.

It prioritizes:
- Reduced mental load
- Operational clarity
- Workflows that match how fiber people actually work
- Trustworthy numbers over real-time theatrics

It avoids:
- Feature parity with generic ecommerce platforms
- Marketing-first tooling
- Over-configurability
- Silent background "sync" that hides responsibility

Clarity is treated as a feature.

## Target Market

Fibermade is built for the **fiber community** — the makers, stores, and customers that make up the fiber world.

Dyers, pattern designers, tool makers, spinners, fiber sellers, yarn shops, and the people who buy from them.

Starting with dyers, expanding to serve the full ecosystem.

It does not aim to serve:
- Generic ecommerce sellers
- Mass-produced goods
- Sellers who want maximum customization over clarity
- Businesses that prioritize marketing optimization over operational reality

Focus is a feature.

See [Personas.md](Personas.md) for detailed user personas.

## What Fibermade Is Not

Fibermade does not aim to:
- Be a general ecommerce platform
- Be a marketing automation tool
- Compete feature-for-feature with Shopify or Square
- Hide operational complexity behind "magic"

Fibermade prefers honesty over automation.

## Long-Term Positioning

If Fibermade succeeds, the fiber community should say:

> "Other tools let me sell online.
> Fibermade actually understands my business."

That distinction is the vision.
