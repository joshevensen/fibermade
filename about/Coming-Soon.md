# Fibermade

## A commerce platform built for the fiber community

Fibermade is being built around one idea:
**the fiber community deserves tools that actually understand how it works.**

This isn't a generic ecommerce tool reskinned for makers.
And it isn't trying to turn small-batch dyers into factories.

## The problem we're obsessed with

If you dye yarn, you've probably felt this:

- Inventory that looks correct online but doesn't match what's actually on your shelves
- Wholesale orders scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and PDFs
- Dye days planned from memory, notes, or last-minute math
- A constant low-grade anxiety about overcommitting without meaning to

Most tools are great at selling things.
Very few understand how those things are actually made.

## What Fibermade believes

- The fiber community works differently than generic ecommerce
- Inventory should support planning, not just sales
- Wholesale shouldn't require industrial-scale systems
- Fewer decisions beats infinite flexibility
- Replacing tools should be earned, not forced

These principles shape everything Fibermade is becoming.

## What's coming

Fibermade is being built in deliberate stages.

It starts by helping dyers:
- plan production with confidence
- manage wholesale without spreadsheets
- trust their inventory again

Some sellers may use Fibermade alongside existing storefronts.
Others may eventually use it as their primary selling surface.

The exact shape will be earned through real use, not promised upfront.

## Who this is for

Fibermade is for the fiber community — dyers, store owners, and the relationships between them.

Starting with hand-dyed yarn businesses that:
- work in small batches
- sell wholesale selectively
- care about reliability without going industrial
- want less mental load, not more features

It's probably not for:
- drop-shippers
- mass-produced goods
- sellers who want endless customization over clear defaults

That focus is intentional.
