# Comments: Code-Only Context

Do **not** add comments that reference context outside the codebase:

- Story names, epic names, prompt numbers, ticket IDs (e.g. "Story 0.2", "Prompt 1")
- Planning docs, roadmap references, "will be added later in X"

Comments **should** describe the code itself:

- What the code does or why this implementation choice
- Non-obvious behavior, invariants, or constraints that the code enforces

**Example**

```php
// ❌ BAD — references external planning
// API routes (Story 0.2) will use the default api middleware group with auth:sanctum.

// ✅ GOOD — describes the code
// We do not call statefulApi() so the API is token-only (stateless).
```
