# Project-Specific Guidelines

These guidelines are specific to this project and should be followed when working on this codebase.

## UI Components

- Always use `@resources/js/components/ui/` components if available before creating new components or using third-party components directly.
- Check the UI components directory (`resources/js/components/ui/`) for existing components that match your needs.
- These components provide a consistent API and styling across the application.

## Code Formatting

- You must run `npm run format` in addition to running `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure both PHP and frontend code matches the project's expected style.
- Run formatting commands after making code changes to ensure consistency.
