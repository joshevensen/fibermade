# Fibermade Dyer Personas

Personas are defined by how dyers operate and sell, not by years in business.
Online sales are assumed for all personas and are not a differentiator.

---

## James  
**Small Batch · Show-First**

### How James operates
James dyes in small, flexible batches. Colorways and quantities shift often based on intuition and recent sales. Most revenue comes from markets, trunk shows, and festivals. Online sales support shows but do not drive planning.

James values freedom and responsiveness over optimization. Selling out feels like success, even if the process is messy.

### What James is looking for in a tool
- Fast show prep without heavy upfront planning
- Lightweight inventory tracking that tolerates uncertainty
- Clear visibility into what sold at each show
- Simple workflows that don’t assume long-term commitments

### Features James wants
- Show-centric sales tracking
- Simple inventory adjustments
- Post-show reconciliation
- Minimal required setup

### Features James does NOT want
- Mandatory batch planning
- Wholesale-first assumptions
- Rigid inventory enforcement
- Tools that push subscriptions or recurring commitments

## Stephanie  
**Small Batch · Wholesale-Selective**

### How Stephanie operates
Stephanie dyes small batches with an emphasis on consistency. She sells to a limited number of stores she trusts, often with flexible minimums and expectations. Wholesale matters, but she is careful not to overcommit.

Stephanie lives in the tension between creativity and reliability. She wants to be dependable without becoming industrial.

### What Stephanie is looking for in a tool
- Clear, low-stress wholesale workflows
- Support for small minimums and flexible ordering
- Help planning batches without locking into rigid schedules
- Systems that understand dyeing realities

### Features Stephanie wants
- Wholesale order management with flexible minimums
- Dye lists that reflect actual commitments
- Clear store communication tools
- Inventory planning that allows variation

### Features Stephanie does NOT want
- All-or-nothing wholesale workflows
- Assumptions of large batch sizes
- Generic ecommerce language
- Pressure to scale faster than she wants

## David  
**Production Scale · Wholesale-First**

### How David operates
David runs a production-oriented dye operation. Dyeing is planned, repeatable, and scheduled well in advance. Wholesale orders and recurring commitments drive production decisions. Online sales exist but are secondary to stability.

David values predictability and accuracy. He is willing to sacrifice spontaneity for reliability.

### What David is looking for in a tool
- Clear translation from orders to production plans
- Strong inventory and order accuracy
- Support for recurring revenue like subscriptions
- Systems that feel durable and business-ready

### Features David wants
- Robust dye lists and production planning

### Features David does NOT want
- Ambiguous inventory states
- Manual reconciliation across systems
- Features that feel experimental or fragile
- Show-first assumptions baked into workflows

## Laura  
**Production Scale · Show-Heavy**

### How Laura operates
Laura runs a large operation and relies heavily on festivals and events. Dyeing is scaled, but quantities and color emphasis shift based on show performance and regional demand. Wholesale exists, but shows are a major driver.

Laura is comfortable with complexity as long as the system bends instead of breaking.

### What Laura is looking for in a tool
- Efficient show prep at scale
- Tools to decide what to bring and how much
- Flexible inventory that moves between channels
- Fast, accurate post-show reconciliation

### Features Laura wants
- Show planning and prep tools
- Channel-aware inventory
- Sales reporting by show or event
- Flexible allocation of stock

### Features Laura does NOT want
- Treating shows as “just another order”
- Rigid inventory systems that can’t absorb chaos
- Wholesale-only mental models
- Overly simplified workflows that hide complexity

## Key Takeaway

Fibermade cannot optimize for all four personas equally at all times.
Each persona represents a different set of tradeoffs:

- James trades predictability for freedom
- Stephanie trades growth speed for sustainability
- David trades flexibility for stability
- Laura trades simplicity for adaptability

Product defaults, language, and onboarding will inevitably favor some of these tradeoffs over others.
That choice should be intentional.
