# Fibermade Strategy

## Purpose
Fibermade exists to be the **operational system of record** for hand-dyed yarn businesses.

Not a plugin.
Not an add-on.
Not a marketing tool.

Fibermade understands production reality first, and everything else flows from that truth.

---

## Core Belief: Production Reality Beats Presentation
Most ecommerce tools treat storefronts, checkout, and marketing as the center of truth.

Fibermade deliberately inverts this.

- **Production reality is the center**: inventory truth, commitments, reconciliation, and dye work.
- **Sales surfaces are projections**: online storefronts, wholesale orders, in-person sales.
- **Communication reflects facts**: emails are triggered by real events, not intent.

This inversion reduces mistakes, anxiety, and overcommitment for small-batch dyers.

---

## Launch Philosophy
Fibermade launches as a **complete system**, not a partial one.

From day one, Fibermade owns:
- Catalog
- Inventory truth
- Orders (retail, wholesale, in-person)
- Customers
- Payments
- Transactional communication
- Production commitments

There is no period where authority is split across systems.

External tools are optional migration sources, not dependencies.

---

## Scope Discipline
Fibermade is intentionally opinionated.

It prioritizes:
- Reduced mental load
- Operational clarity
- Explicit actions over automation illusions
- Trustworthy numbers over real-time theatrics

It avoids:
- Feature parity with generic ecommerce platforms
- Marketing-first tooling
- Over-configurability
- Silent background “sync” that hides responsibility

Clarity is treated as a feature.

---

## Target Customer

Fibermade is built exclusively for the **hand-dyed yarn segment of the fiber community**, and it is intentionally biased toward how dyers actually operate.

Personas are defined by *how work gets done*, not by size, revenue, or years in business.

### Primary Fit

Fibermade is built first for dyers like **Stephanie**:

- Small-batch producers
- Wholesale-selective, relationship-driven
- Balancing creativity with reliability
- Actively trying to avoid overcommitting
- Feeling constant pressure to “keep it all straight”

For this persona, Fibermade’s value is:
- Clear wholesale workflows without industrial assumptions
- Inventory truth they can trust
- Production commitments that reduce anxiety
- Systems that help them decide what to dye next without locking them in

This persona defines Fibermade’s defaults, language, and workflow bias.

### Supported (but Not Optimized First)

Fibermade also supports other operating styles, with intentional tradeoffs:

**James — Small Batch · Show-First**
- Values flexibility and speed over structure
- Uses Fibermade for order capture, inventory awareness, and reconciliation
- Will benefit more as show features expand post-launch

**David — Production Scale · Wholesale-First**
- Values predictability and accuracy
- Uses Fibermade for wholesale management, inventory truth, and production planning
- Will benefit from subscriptions and advanced reporting later

**Laura — Production Scale · Show-Heavy**
- Comfortable with complexity
- Uses Fibermade to manage inventory across channels and reconcile after chaos
- Will benefit from deeper show and POS tooling over time

Fibermade cannot optimize for all personas equally at launch.
That choice is deliberate.

---

### Explicit Non-Target

Fibermade does not aim to serve:
- Generic ecommerce sellers
- The broader craft world
- Sellers who want maximum customization over clarity
- Businesses that prioritize marketing optimization over production reality

Focus is a feature.

---

## Migration, Not Integration
Fibermade does not embed itself inside other platforms or rely on app store approvals.

Migration is handled through:
- Explicit imports (catalog, inventory, orders)
- Explicit exports (orders, inventory)
- Clear ownership of data once imported

This avoids sync illusions and makes responsibility visible and auditable.

---

## What Fibermade Is Not
Fibermade does not aim to:
- Be a general ecommerce platform
- Be a POS-first system
- Be a marketing automation tool
- Compete feature-for-feature with Shopify or Square
- Hide operational complexity behind “magic”

Fibermade prefers honesty over automation.

---

## Long-Term Positioning
If Fibermade succeeds, customers should say:

> “Other tools help me sell yarn.  
> Fibermade helps me run my business.”

That distinction is the strategy.
